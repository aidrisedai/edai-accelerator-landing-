## About the Program

The EdAI Accelerator is designed for Muslim teenagers (7th grade and above) who want more than just learning—they want to create products that deliver real-world value. Our program takes students from ideation to real-world value creation, powered by our patent-pending ForgeFlow Orchestrator.
